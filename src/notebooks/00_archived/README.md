# Archived Notebooks

This directory contains archived notebooks that are no longer actively used but kept for reference.

## Guidelines

- Move notebooks here when they are no longer in active development
- Include a brief description of what each notebook was used for
- Consider whether the notebook should be deleted entirely or kept for historical reference
- Update this README when adding new archived notebooks

## Archived Files

- `old_analysis_v1.ipynb`: Initial data analysis (replaced by newer version)
- `experimental_model.ipynb`: Experimental modeling approach (not pursued)

## Cleanup

Review archived notebooks quarterly and delete those that are no longer needed.
